# AI-MCTS-Research
Undergraduate AI Research implements Java and Open MPI in the game Dots and Boxes to run simulations in parallel. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search, the directed acyclic graphs containing data at some given moment is combined to determine the next best move.

PuTTY utilized to run batch files on High Performance Computing. The generation of the 100+ batch files is computerized through a simple external Java program.
